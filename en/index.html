			<h1>Projects</h1>
			<p><strong><a href="https://historymap-e4826.web.app/">HistoryMap</a> Web App</strong> (2022 - now)</p>
			<p>HistoryMap is my personal project, developed with React and Firebase, allowing users to create custom historical maps 
				with detailed markers of significant events. Designed for history educators, this platform offers a valuable tool to display 
				contextualized historical events on an interactive world map. With expertise in frontend development and experience using Firebase, 
				I managed the implementation of key features, including permissions management for private maps and upcoming functionalities, such as 
				map sharing and an ongoing notification system. The integration of LeafletJS provides a smooth and engaging map experience. The 
				website is responsive and thoughtfully designed using Tailwind CSS.</p>
